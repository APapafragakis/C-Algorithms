# X-Pattern Generator

This simple C program generates a pattern resembling an 'X' shape based on user input for the height of the pattern.

## Input Validation

The program includes input validation to ensure that the entered height (`h`) meets certain criteria before generating the 'X' pattern. 

## Example

```plaintext
Give me the height: 5
